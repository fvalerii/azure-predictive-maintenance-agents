# Phase 0 — Setup & Authentication

**Estimated time to reproduce:** ~20 minutes

## Objectives

By the end of this phase you'll have:

- ✅ A fully provisioned Microsoft Foundry project with a deployed model
- ✅ Application Insights provisioned and connection string available
- ✅ Verified authentication from your local machine to Foundry
- ✅ Confirmed your agent endpoint is working

## Get Started

> [!NOTE]
> Before you begin, make sure you have:
> - An **Azure subscription** where you hold both the **Contributor** role (to deploy the infrastructure) and the **Foundry User** role (to build, evaluate, and run agents in Challenges 1–4).
> - A **GitHub handle** (account) to run this repository in GitHub Codespaces, if you choose that option.
>
> Subscription **Owner** (or Contributor) rights alone are **not** sufficient. Those grant control-plane access to create and manage resources, but building and running agents are data-plane operations that require the separate **Foundry User** role assigned on the Foundry account. An Owner can self-assign it; a Contributor must ask an admin to assign it after deployment.

There are two ways to get started — pick one:

### Option A: GitHub Codespaces (recommended)

No local installs needed. Everything runs in a cloud dev environment. Open this repository and click **Code → Codespaces → Create codespace on main**, then in the terminal log in to Azure:

```bash
az login
```

Continue to **Deploy Infrastructure** below.

---

### Option B: Local environment

Run everything on your own machine. Requires Python 3.10+ and Azure CLI.

```bash
# 1. Clone this repo
git clone <this-repo-url>
cd azure-predictive-maintenance-agents

# 2. Create and activate a virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# 3. Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. Log in to Azure
az login
```

Continue to **Deploy Infrastructure** below.

## Deploy Infrastructure

From the repository root, run the deploy script:

```bash
bash challenge-0-setup/deploy.sh
```

This will provision all resources **and** automatically write your `.env` file to the repository root as `.env`. The deployment will take a couple of minutes to complete.

## Verify the creation of your resources

Go to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/) and find your resource group, which should now contain resources like this:

![Azure Portal Resources](./images/azure-portal-resources.png)

> [!NOTE]
> The resource name prefixes vary by scenario and the suffixes are unique for each deployment

Go to the [Microsoft Foundry Portal](https://ai.azure.com/nextgen) and verify that you can access the Foundry project.

![Foundry Project](./images/foundry-project.png)

Select **Build** in the top navigation, then **Models**, and verify that the **gpt-5.4** model is deployed.

>[!NOTE]
> In some versions of the Foundry Portal the **Models** tab is rebranded to **Deployments** but they serve the same purpose.

![Foundry Model](./images/foundry-model.png)

Select **gpt-5.4**, enter a test message in the model playground, and verify that you get a response.

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] You can see your Microsoft Foundry project in the Azure Portal
- [ ] A model deployment for gpt-5.4 shows "Succeeded" status
- [ ] You can send a test message in the Foundry Model Playground
